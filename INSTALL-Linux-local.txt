How to quickly build OpenTransactions on Linux 
with all dependencies installed *locally* (as given user).
- no need to install anything system-wide more then pure debian stable tools
- all speciall dependencies and OT itself is build all locally just as USER
this is where it differs from INSTALL-DebianStable.txt that takes opposite direction.

If you are installing on Debian Stable also see INSTALL-DebianStable-local.txt for list of needed packages.

**Other** ways to install on linux:
- INSTALL-Mac-Linux-FreeBSD.txt - general unix* information
- INSTALL-DebianStable.txt - detail install with adding debian UNSTABLE (sid) libs system-wide

You need Open-Transactions with changes added by <coinmint> github user/fork:
https://github.com/coinmint/Open-Transactions
(if you read this readme file then you probably have the correct version or
it was merged into officiall).

1) INSTALL-DebianStable-local.txt has list of needed tools

2) ./download-and-build-dependencies.sh 
run this script - that will download all 
OT-dependencies from sources and build, checking downloads checksums
(instead of ChaiScript *TODO* that needs git version)
as result ~/local/ will contain the user-locally-installed librariers needed.

3) ./build-php-debian-local.sh 
run it to build OT (the lib, utils, testwallet
and PHP lib) and put it into ~/local/ as user-locally-installed.

4) For actually using PHP module follow general instructions, ofcourse if you
want to have system-wide web/PHP server using OTLib then this step will
need to be NOT isolated to user, but you could also run a web-server 
as an user or even in chroot etc.

See also myot project for examples on using OT from PHP5 script.
