This file describes how to quickly build OpenTransactions with all 
dependencies on Linux or alike (tested on Debian Stable),
- no need to install anything system-wide more then pure debian stable tools
- all speciall dependencies and OT itself is build all locally just as USER
this is where it differs from INSTALL-DebianStable.txt that takes opposite direction.

*Other* ways to install on linux:
- INSTALL-Mac-Linux-FreeBSD.txt - general info
- INSTALL-DebianStable.txt - install with adding debian unstable libs as needed

This readme assumes you have Open-Transactions with changes added by:
https://github.com/coinmint/Open-Transactions

Get Open-Transactions sources,
get all build tools and libs from Debian Stable (or compatible) like g++ make cmake lib-boost(all)
php-dev(if building php) etc.


Run ./download-and-build-dependencies.sh script that will download all 
OT-dependencies from sources and build, checking downloads checksums
(instead of ChaiScript *TODO* that needs git version)
as result ~/local/ will contain the user-locally-installed librariers needed.

Run ./build-php-debian-local.sh to build OT (the lib, utils, testwallet
and PHP lib) and put it into ~/local/ as user-locally-installed.

For actually using PHP module follow general instructions, ofcourse if you
want to have system-wide web/PHP server using OTLib then this step will
need to be NOT isolated to user, but you could also run a web-server 
as an user or even in chroot etc.
